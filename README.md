# cis191.motion_sensor
# We created a music player for your mood/activity level. We used a PIR motion sensor to detect the level of activity in an area
# (number of senses per minute). As the sensor detects motion over some time period, it classifies the level of activity as “low”, “medium”,
# or “high”. Accordingly, it plays either relaxing, slow music, medium-paced pop music, or fast-paced workout music.
